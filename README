The project is set up with a git-submodule for AndEngine pulling from
https://github.com/nicolasgramlich/AndEngine.git.

When you clone/update this repository, make sure that the submodule is
likewise cloned/updated (Eclipse usually does this for you automatically).

To build this on Eclipse, it must first be able to refer to the AndEngine
library project. The source code, once you check out our repository,
is all there under /lib/AndEngine/ directory, but you must first import
it into Eclipse:

1. File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace.
2. Select root directory: /lib/AndEngine/ and follow instruction.
3. That's it! The Tamagotchi Eclipse project itself knows to link against
   AndEngine in /lib/AndEngine so you won't need to set that up.
4. When you build the project, the AndEngine library project will be
   automatically built for you as a dependency.
   
To build this with the ant build script:

1. Make sure you have generated a local.properties file first. This can
   be done by executing:
   > android update project --path .
   from the project's root directory.
2. Make sure you have also done the same with the AndEngine library project:
   lib\AndEngine> android update lib-project --path .
3. Build! When you build from the project's root, the ant built script will
   also take care of building the library project automatically.
