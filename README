To build this with the ant build script:

1. Make sure you have generated a local.properties file first. This can
   be done by executing:
   > android update project --path .
   from the project's root directory.
2. Make sure you have also done the same with each (if any) library project:
   lib\[library]> android update lib-project --path .
3. Build! When you build from the project's root, the ant built script will
   also take care of building library projects (if any) automatically.
